The World Health Organisation (WHO) has commended yet cautioned India over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, warning it of a possible resurgence of cases after the current lockdown in the absence of other important measures.

Answering India Today TV's questions during an interaction with journalists in Geneva (Switzerland), WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised India’s decision to enforce the lockdown at a very early stage.

"India has the capacity and it's very important and good to see that India is taking early measures. This will help suppress and control it before it gets serious," he said.
